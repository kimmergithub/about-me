        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Born in the beautiful state of Montana, I made my way from Missoula to Kennewick, Washington when my father took a job at PNNL.  There I grew up a happy child, excited to explore the world around me.  I loved playing sports and working in teams, and had an analytical knack that put in place as the captain of serval of my teams.  When I graduated highschool, always wanting to head into a big city, I moved to the sunny state of Arizona and attended ASU where I gradutated with a Bachelor's.
